Routes:
-> save Routes as 
    -   files in a directory ( We would be saving these in a directory within/next to the source files) 
    -   OR we save it as a string in a new DB.

    -> File? 2 files: route.js & map.html(or would we always reuse this html for all other routes)
    -> DB: all new db logic (too much?)


--> Test Leaflet ( same issue as with the mock Map? )

--> reDo all unittests to be uptodate with the repository & Docker DB



--> Logging
